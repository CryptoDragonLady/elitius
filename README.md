Introduction
------------

eLitius is an open source affiliate management software. It is built on top of [Subrion CMS][] framework and utilizes the
same core structure that makes it compatible with the tons of free extensions & templates.
It's an easy solution to build own affiliate tracking system to increase sales and pay commissions for the traffic sent
